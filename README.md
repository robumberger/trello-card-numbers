Hey there ðŸ‘‹ This is a super simple Trello Power-Up that adds card numbers to the front of cards for easy reference.

To enable it, go to the Power-Up admin page: [https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)

Add a new powerup, and for the manifest URL use `https://webrender.github.io/trello-costello/manifest.json`

After adding, the Power-Up should be available via your board menu.
